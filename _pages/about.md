I am pursuing  a PhD in Cryptography at [LIMOS](https://limos.fr/) and [Be-Ys](https://www.be-ys.com/) under the supervision of Pascal Lafourcade, Olivier Blazy, and Olivier Raynaud. My research focuses on applied cryptography, digital signatures, and lattice-based primitives.

I completed my undergraduate studies at [Jerash University](https://www.jpu.edu.jo/jpu/) (2018) and my MSc at [ISIMA](https://www.isima.fr/) (2024).

Industry experience: I worked at Be‑Ys (2023–2024) on the design and development of a data‑processing platform. Previously, I was a backend developer and software solution architect at ESKADENIA Software (2018–2022), building telecom software including CRM, billing, and mediation systems.

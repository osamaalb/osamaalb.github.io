I am doing a PhD in Cryptography at [LIMOS](https://limos.fr/) and [BeYs](https://www.be-ys.com/) under the supervision of Pascal Lafourcade, Olivier Blazy, and Olivier Raynaud. I did my undergraduate studies at [Jerash University](https://www.jpu.edu.jo/jpu/) and my master in [ISIMA, Clermont-Auvergne University](https://www.isima.fr/).
